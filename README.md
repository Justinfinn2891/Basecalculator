# Base Calculator

- This project is performed for the small purpose of practicing with my C++ skills and express my knowledge in computing base conversion in the mainly used conversions: (base 2) (base 10) and (base 16). After finishing my discrete structures courses, I have learned and developed the ability to think how the computer computes data and takes the language and numbers we speak and quickly turn it into an assembly language they can understand (and vice versa).

# HOW TO USE
- This project isn't super complicated right now so it's fairly easy to startup. Download the repo and place it into the IDE of your choosing and run it in the terminal.
